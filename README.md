# j_plg_hrz_disablelogin
This plugin prevents users to login in the frontend. It blocks access to direct addresses like `?option=com_users` and `component/users`. Use this in combination with hiding all login forms and login pages.

If you also want to prevent unauthorized access to the backend, you might want to have a look at [plg_hrz_block_access](https://github.com/alve89/j_plg_hrz_block_access)
